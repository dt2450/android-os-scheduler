Methods used to test the scheduler:
===================================
- Started the browser with multiple tabs, then set it to background.
- Downloaded and installed large apps like games and antivirus (to see background activity)
- Started own test processes (listed above) to see if enqueuing / dequeuing / balancing was happening properly.

Visualizing scheduler load:
===========================
The code put in debug.c by us now prints statistics for the GRR scheduler, eg. the no. of tasks, their PIDs, names and group information.
To download the information from the emulator/device, use the command:

adb pull /proc/sched_debug
The file sched_debug contains the statistics for our GRR scheduler.
